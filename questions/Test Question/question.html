    <p>
      In the partial game tree below, we represent maximizing nodes as △; minimizing nodes ▽. 
      Determine the values for the nodes that would be determined by the minimax algorithm 
      without pruning, and indicate which edges would not be traversed (would be pruned) 
      as a result of alpha-beta pruning. Assume we evaluate the children of a node from 
      left to right, and that all values are integers.
