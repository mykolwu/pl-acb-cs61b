  A polynomial function is a function with coefficients, variables and
  constants. A polynomial function is said to be the nth degree polynomial
  if there is a term in the function with the variable to the nth degree.
  For example, a 4th degree polynomial must contain the term x^4 with some
  coefficient multiplied to it.<br><br>

  Write a function that takes a list of coefficients (from 0th to nth degree)
  and a value <code>x</code>, and returns the polynomial computed at
  <code>x</code>.<br><br>

  Write this function using a <b>for</b> loop, not a <b>while</b> loop.<br><br>

  <pl-code>
  >> poly([4], 2) # 4*(2**0)
  4
  >> poly([4, 5], 2) # 4*(2**0) + 5*(2**1)
  14
  >> poly([2,4,7], 6) # 2*(6**0) + 4*(6**1) + 7*(6**2)
  276
